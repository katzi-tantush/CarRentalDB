- RentedCar has a CarID field. this is meant to be both the ID and a foregin key in Cars -> how do I make this so in the db?
at the moment its represented just fine
- Is it Ok that CarID is the primary key and not the car number? 
- in login controller: is the long if statement for checking the username and password the right way of doing things?
- what are the issuer and audince properties?
- how to store images in db?
